Implement a pomodoro timer (complete) and stopwatch (incomplete) into Neovim as a plugin written in Lua. Tomato = Pomodoro. WIP.

I've used the pomodoro method for years, especially while coding, and I wanted to embed it within Neovim to reduce application clutter.

Although there are versions in Vimscript, I was inspired by [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen) and [TJ DeVries](https://github.com/tjdevries) to write my own plugin in Lua. The justification for this project was that I wanted to learn more Lua while converting my Neovim config from Vimscript to Lua, not to make a "blazingly-fast", hyper-performant refactor of a pomodoro timer.
